Nothing is known of the taxon in life, and it is assumed to be extinct (Stattersfield et al. 1998). The holotype has red legs and may have had a red bill (its bill sheath is now missing) but is otherwise similar to Micronesian Kingfisher T. cinnamominus and some authors have considered the taxon a subspecies of this (Fry et al. 1992). The validity of the holotype has also been questioned, with suggestions that it may have been a vagrant from Guam, an escaped cagebird, or mislabelled (Brazil 1991). Maybe because of these uncertainties, the taxon was removed from the 1996 Red List (Baillie and Groombridge 1996).",32386,,,

The specific separation of ramsayi is all the more arguable for the geographically closest representative of maculatus - fulvifasciatus of Mindanao and Basilan showing the strongest pied effect. The notion that these two forms are ""bridged"" by maculatus, with a throw-away description of ramsayi as ""aberrant"" (Salomonsen 1953), not only fails to deal with the suggestion of Voous (1947) that ramsayi represents an early invasion of the Philippines, but also misses the point that maculatus is not geographically interposed between the two forms it is supposed to bridge.

Suggestions of differences in habitat preference between sub-montane and montane argentea and rufugularis, for the most part a bird of low- and medium altitude forest, are confounded by the fact that the latter ranges up to 2,400 m in W Kenya, comparable to the maximum altitude at which argentea has been recorded.

Turdidae,Thrushes,,Turdus roehli,"Reichenow, 1905",NR,NR,,,,,,,,,,,,,Y,Bowie et al. (2005),,,"Species status for roehli was argued by Bowie et al. (2005), stating that it is 4% divergent from the forms helleri and nyikae and claiming that ""either helleri or roehli are sister to all other forms of the 'abyssinicus' clade"". However, they did not analyse DNA from oldeani or deckeni, which form a bridge in characters to or from roehli, with deckeni forming a clear geographical and morphological stepping stone from roehli north to abyssinicus, nor do they discuss them in any way in relation to the proposed establishment of roehli as a species. Moreover, the morphological distinctiveness of roehli, particularly in relation to deckeni, is not very strong. The BirdLife Taxonomic Working Group does not therefore accept it as a species and considers that it appears perfectly in place as the end of a cline of characters from abyssinicus through deckeni.",32238,,,

Fringillidae,Finches and Hawaiian honeycreepers,Scottish Crossbill,Loxia scotica,"Hartert, 1904",R,LC,Y,,,,,Y,,,,Y,,,,,,,"Loxia crossbills are conifer seed specialists for which there is an increasing body of evidence to show that bill morphology and overall body size, the main morphological features by which forms vary, are intimately linked to the cone structure and size of the particular conifer species (or mosaics of species) upon which they feed. There is also increasing evidence that different populations of crossbills show differences in flight and excitement calls which co-vary with bill shape, and hence with the distributions of their main food sources (e.g. Borras et al. 2008, Edelaar 2008a, 2008b). This evidence is especially well developed in the case of the Scottish Crossbill Loxia scotica by Summers et al. (2002, 2007) to support treatment of L. scotica as a species distinct from both Common Crossbill L. curvirostra and Parrot Crossbill L. pytyopsittacus. In particular, Summers et al. (2007) present data to show that, in areas of broad sympatry in Scotland, these forms largely breed assortatively. Although they do show some degree of hybridisation, in the view of Summers et al. (2007) this is insufficient not to warrant recognition as species, despite overlaps in morphology and the lack of any genetic differentiation. Some uncertainty remains regarding the status of this form, and an alternative approach is to regard different vocal types as components of a single resource-polymorphic species. Assortative mating by voice-type could prove to be a consequence of post-pairing vocal copying. More generally, increasing numbers of vocal types are being discovered among sympatric populations of crossbills whenever sufficiently detailed studies are carried out. The American Ornithologists' Union (BirdLife's taxonomic source for North America) has yet to recognise any of the nine North American 'vocal types' as species, although the case for the first of these was made over twenty years ago (Groth 1988). Nevertheless, given the evidence currently available and associated uncertainties, BirdLife continues to follow the Association of European Rarities Committees in treating L. scotica as a species distinct from L. curvirostra and L. pytyopsittacus.",8877,,,
